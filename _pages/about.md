I'm a Cyber Security professional who plays around with tech, finance and games in my spare time. 

This blog is a place for me to document my work (where I can), provide context for potential employers, and develop my writing.

You can contact me via email or my LinkedIn profile at the bottom of the page.

I have had a career with many twists and turns, starting in sales, finishing university and changing to finance. I eventually left for the Army where I worked as an analyst and linguist. Within the Army I became an officer, and trained as a pilot before restarting again and moving into IT. 

My unique experiences have led to my personal perspective which I am attempting to document here in this blog and hopefully provide some value for others.
