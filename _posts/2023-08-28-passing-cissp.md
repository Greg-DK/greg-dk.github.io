As a cyber security professional, the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification had been on my radar for a few years. Due to RPL credits available from CSU I finally decided to take the plunge and tackle this challenging exam. In this post, I'll share my personal experience and the resources that proved invaluable in my  CISSP success.

## Benchmarking

As I already had experience in some of the CISSP domains I decided to start my study with the first official practice exam to gauge my weak areas and how close I was to passing. Most people attempting the CISSP exam will be in a similar position, and I think reading the book cover to cover is unnecessary. On my first practice exam I achieved a passing score (barely), was able to determine my weak domains, and see how the questions were roughly formulated. It was this initial success that enabled me to be confident in scheduling my exam at short notice for not an insubstantial cost (~$1250 AUD).

## Study

### Week 1

As the first week rolled in I set clear study goals and dedicated several hours each day to immerse myself in CISSP knowledge. My trusty companion was the Official (ISC)² CISSP Study Guide, which provided a solid foundation across all domains. I focused on the areas where I had scored poorly in the exam.

During this week, I also turned to LinkedIn Learning for supplementary materials. The video course is done by [Mike Chapple](www.certmike.com) and I just watched it from beginning to end playing it on a second screen while I multitasked. 

### Week 2

The second week was all about diving deep into the exam domains. I completed a full practice exam each day on the weekend. For this I used the (ISC)² Official CISSP App—an invaluable resource for practice questions and exams. It enabled me to quickly do batches of questions, and had the official exams already loaded. For the $26/mth cost I'd skip buying the practice exam book and just use the app.

### Week 3

With the final week at hand, I had completed a LOT of practice questions. It was time to fine-tune my knowledge and practice under exam-like conditions. I took simulated CISSP practice exams to gauge my progress and identify areas that needed reinforcement. Each practice test helped build my confidence and prepared me for the real exam.

The actual  experience was quite unnerving, the dynamic testing used in the CISSP exam meant it was difficult to gauge how well I was doing. Each question got progressively more difficult, and when it would sharply get easier it was easy to feel like I'd got the previous one wrong. Despite this the pain was over in about an hour;  the exam ended at Q.125 and I received my assessment sheet showing I had passed.

## Conclusion:

After three intense weeks of studying, I was ready to take the CISSP exam. In the end, my work paid off, and I earned my CISSP certification.

**Recommendations:**

1. Embrace the Official (ISC)² CISSP Study Guide as your go-to resource for comprehensive learning.

2. Leverage the (ISC)² Official CISSP App for domain-focused practice and assessments.

3. Take simulated CISSP practice exams to fine-tune your knowledge and build confidence.

Remember,  CISSP isn't about passing an exam—it's a stamp on your resume to show that you meet a minimum proficiency level, and someone has vouched for your experience. It's important to know that like all certifications, they don't really mean anything once you're at work, or even at the interview.

Stay determined and embrace the study that will get you through the CISSP exam. Best of luck on your adventure!
